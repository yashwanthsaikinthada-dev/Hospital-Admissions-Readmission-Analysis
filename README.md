# 🏥 Hospital Readmission Analysis & Automated Reporting

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes hospital admission data to identify patterns in patient readmissions, hospital stay duration, medication usage, glucose test results, and specialty distribution.

The objective of this project is to generate actionable insights that help healthcare management reduce readmission rates, optimize treatment strategies, and improve operational efficiency.

This is an end-to-end data analytics project integrating:

• SQL for data extraction and aggregation  
• Python for data processing and automation  
• Data Visualization for insight presentation  
• Automated MS Word report generation

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- python-docx
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Readmission Distribution Analysis
- Calculated total readmission counts.
- Compared readmitted vs non-readmitted patients.
- Visualized distribution using bar and pie charts.
- Identified overall readmission trends.

---

### 2️⃣ Average Hospital Stay by Specialty
- Computed average time in hospital grouped by medical specialty.
- Identified departments with longer patient stay durations.
- Evaluated potential workload imbalance across specialties.

---

### 3️⃣ Medication vs Hospital Stay Trend
- Analyzed relationship between number of medications and time in hospital.
- Generated line plots to observe treatment intensity trends.
- Identified possible patterns between longer stays and medication count.

---

### 4️⃣ Glucose Test Result vs Readmission
- Performed grouped SQL aggregation.
- Created stacked bar charts for glucose test categories.
- Compared readmission rates across glucose result types.
- Identified potential correlation between test results and patient return rate.

---

### 5️⃣ Specialty Case Distribution
- Extracted top 10 medical specialties by total admissions.
- Highlighted departments with highest patient volume.
- Provided operational insight into hospital workload distribution.

## 🔄 Automation Feature (Project Highlight)

A key highlight of this project is the automated report generation system.

The script:

✔ Executes SQL queries  
✔ Generates charts automatically  
✔ Inserts tables and visualizations into MS Word  
✔ Saves final report into a structured output folder

## 📈 Business Value

This analysis can support hospital management by:

- Identifying high-risk readmission groups
- Understanding specialty-based patient load
- Evaluating treatment intensity patterns
- Supporting data-driven decision making
- Improving operational planning

---
## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Add predictive modeling for readmission (Logistic Regression)
- Perform statistical hypothesis testing
- Build interactive dashboard (Power BI / Tableau)
- Deploy as a web-based analytics reporting system
- Add data cleaning & preprocessing documentation
